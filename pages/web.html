        Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and
        maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include web
        design, web programming, and database management.

    <h2>Html</h2><hr>
    <p>
        In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
        researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext
        system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year,
        Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the
        project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many
        areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]

        The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on the
        Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively
        simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house
        Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still
        exist in HTML 4.[8]

    <h2>CSS</h2><hr>
    <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
        written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS
        is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
        This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
        presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
        separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file
        to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

    <h2>Java script</h2><hr>
    <p>
        JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
        technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the
        client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a
        dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11]
        It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
        supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
        interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
        Object Model (DOM).

    <h2>React.JS</h2><hr>
    <p>
        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library[3][4] for
        building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of
        individual developers and companies.[5][6][7]

        React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js.
        Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications
        often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.[8][9]
